## Dataset
The analysis uses the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) Wave 7 dataset, focusing on adults aged 50 and over in England.

## Methodology
The methodology of the report involves statistical analyses to explore the determinants of happiness among older adults in England, including descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests for categorical variables, and Binary Logistic regression to examine the relationship between happiness and variables like loneliness, anxiety, gender, financial constraints, health, and alcohol consumption. 

## Results
The result highlights significant associations between happiness and all examined variables except for alcohol consumption, pointing out that loneliness, anxiety, financial constraints, and health significantly affect happiness levels in the elderly. These findings suggest a complex interplay of psychological, social, and economic factors in determining happiness among older adults.
